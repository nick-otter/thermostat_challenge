# Thermostat

Weekend task assigned by [Kay Lovelace](https://github.com/neoeno), [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/).

You'll build the business logic to model a simple thermostat, and learn to hook it up to a dynamic visual interface using jQuery - all within the browser. Finally, you'll use JavaScript to fetch data from external sources and display that on the page - again, all right from the page. Underpinning all this will be a new testing framework to help you test-drive your JavaScript code - Jasmine.
